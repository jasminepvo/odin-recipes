    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Penne alla vodka is a pasta dish made with vodka and penne pasta, usually made with heavy cream, crushed tomatoes, onions, and sometimes sausage, pancetta or peas. The recipe became very popular in Italy and in the United States around the 1980s, when it was offered to discotheque customers.Penne pasta cooked in a red creamy sauce, the alcohol is cooked off so don't worry!</p>

    </ul>
    <h3><em>Instructions:</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil pasta noodles a little before al dente</li>
        <li>Heat oil on large saucepan and sautee garlic</li>
        <li>Throw on vegetables in order of how you want the rawness of the texture. I do onions, wait for them to brown a lil then mushrooms for a minute then bell peppers.</li>
        <li>Half the pan and throw on chicken and cook. You can also choose to cook the chicken in a seperate pan.</li>
        <li>Then half the pan again and add tomato paste & pepper flakes. Fry off the pepper flakes before adding a bit of vodka.</li>
        <li>Add a cup or so of heavy whipping cream, I eyeball it till it taste good. Ideal consistency is orange and a slightly thick texture. </li>
        <li>Add pasta and cup of pasta water to make it creamy and top with cilantro or parsley.</li>
    </ol>
